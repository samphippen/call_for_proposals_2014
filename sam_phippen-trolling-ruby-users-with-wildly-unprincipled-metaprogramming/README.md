#Trolling Ruby users with wildly unprincipled metaprogramming

Tell don't ask, prefer composition over inheritance, write failing tests first:
these are all principles that we Rubyists love. What happens if we enforce them
with metaprogramming? What happens if we stop you from doing them? How badly
can we break ruby? What happens when you strain the limits of Matz's wonderful
vision?

Do not expect to build production code from this talk: prepare to be
entertained, trolled, and maybe actually learn a useful thing or two.
